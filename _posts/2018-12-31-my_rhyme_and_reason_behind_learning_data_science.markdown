My decision to enroll at Flatiron School was a massive undertaking. While it was easy to imagine myself learning data science skills and working full-time as a management consultant, I quickly realized that acting on it was another story. Time management is no longer an option. Sleeping-in is a precious commodity. Hanging out with friends is something that needs to be planned well in advance around study sessions. Meanwhile, do I regret the decision to enroll at Flatiron? Not for a second. 

Before making this commitment, I thoroughly analzed all the pros and cons of the decision and reflected on why I was pursuing this path. In the end, it came down to asking myself, "Will I regret not taking this opportunity?" And the answer was yes. I thought that at 24 years of age, now was the time to take a leap of faith. Below, I outline some of the major reasons why I've decided to pursue a career as a data scientist:


1. **I have an innate curiosity about how decisions are made.** As a management consultant, I get a firsthand look at decision-making processes every single day. What I've found is that humans aren't the best decision-makers. It's important to value the *process* of arriving at a conclusion over the actual *result*.  Positive results can lead business leaders, general managers, and government officials to thinking that the process itself was the correct one when in fact, it was merely luck. Bad decision-making processes will revert to the mean and return losses more often than not. This is where I believe data science can lend a hand.

By combining industry knowledge with data analysis and actionable insights from that data, organizations can greatly improve their decision-making processes. Sports franchises no longer need to judge potential draft picks by whether or not they have the ["it factor"](http://http://grantland.com/features/it-factor-nfl-quarterback-intangibles/).  Businesses no longer need to make assumptions when they decide to launch a new product line. My hope is that by the end of this program, I will have the data science skills to help an organization or sports franchise make long-term decisions that are in their best interest.

2. **Data science spans across every industry.** Sports. Oil and gas. Shopping. Banking. Venture capital. Marketing. Consulting. Real estate. Anywhere there is data, data science skills play a significant role. Although I graduated with a bachelor's degree, I quickly realized upon graduation that I didn't have the skills to set myself apart from other graduates. This is when I began exploring what other skills I should set out to learn. Not only will data science set me apart from other recent graduates and make me a more appealing employee across a variety of industries, but it will also prepare me for the future when data science plays an even bigger role in the world.

3. **I wanted to take on a major challenge.** As Sam Altman from Y Combinator wisely put it in his [blog] (http://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short), "Life is not a dress rehearsal—this is probably it.  Make it count.  Time is extremely limited and goes by fast.  Do what makes you happy and fulfilled—few people get remembered hundreds of years after they die anyway."

The days are long, but the decades are short. I want to learn as much as I possibly can during my lifetime and waste no day. This course has provided me with the opportunity to not only learn an exponential amount every day, but to also stay in the present and focus on hitting daily and weekly goals rather than feeling lost in a sea of choices.

4. **I missed being in a learning environment.** I'm fortunate that where I went to school and my family environment instilled in me a desire to learn and be curious about the way the world works (which from my brief experience learning data science, I see both as critical traits to being a successful data scientist). Immediately after college, I missed being in a classroom environment. I found myself in a job where I wasn't learning. I felt trapped and as if my progress as an individual had stagnated. After transitioning jobs to one that challenges me and has a healthier work-life balance, I came across the chance to learn at Flatiron and be a part of a classroom setting once more. The opportunity to supplement my job with learning data science was something I couldn't pass up.
